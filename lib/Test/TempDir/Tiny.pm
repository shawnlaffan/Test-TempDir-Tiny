=func tempdir

    $dir = tempdir();          # .../default_1/
    $dir = tempdir("label");   # .../label_1/

Creates a directory underneath a test-file-specific temporary directory and
returns the absolute path to it in platform-native form (i.e. with backslashes
on Windows).

The function takes a single argument as a label for the directory or defaults
to "default". An incremental counter value will be appended to allow a label to
be used within a loop with distinct temporary directories:

    # t/foo.t

    for ( 1 .. 3 ) {
        tempdir("in loop");
    }

    # creates:
    #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_1
    #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_2
    #   ./tmp/t_foo_t/in_loop_3

If the label contains any characters besides alphanumerics, underscore
and dash, they will be collapsed and replaced with a single underscore.

    $dir = tempdir("a space"); # .../a_space_1/
    $dir = tempdir("a!bang");  # .../a_bang_1/

The test-file-specific directory and all directories within it will be cleaned
up with an END block if the current test file passes tests.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module works with L<Test::More> to create temporary directories that stick
around if tests fail.

It is loosely based on L<Test::TempDir>, but with less complexity, greater
portability and zero non-core dependencies.  (L<Capture::Tiny> is recommended
for testing.)

The L</tempdir> function is exported by default.  When called, it constructs a
directory tree to hold temporary directories.

If the current directory is writable, the root for directories will be
F<./tmp>.  Otherwise, a L<File::Temp> directory will be created wherever
temporary directories are stored for your system.

Every F<*.t> file gets its own subdirectory under the root based on the test
filename, but with slashes and periods replaced with underscores.  For example,
F<t/foo.t> would get a test-file-specific subdirectory F<./tmp/t_foo_t/>.
Directories created by L</tempdir> get put in that directory.  This makes it
very easy to find files later if tests fail.

The test-file-specific name is consistent from run-to-run.  If an old directory
already exists, it will be removed.

When the test file exits, if all tests passed, then the test-file-specific
directory is recursively removed.

If a test failed and the root directory is F<./tmp>, the test-file-specific
directory sticks around for inspection.  (But if the root is a L<File::Temp>
directory, it is always discarded).

If nothing is left in F<./tmp> (i.e. no other test file failed), then F<./tmp>
is cleaned up as well.

This module attempts to avoid race conditions due to parallel testing.  In
extreme cases, the test-file-specific subdirectory might be created as a
regular L<File::Temp> directory rather than in F<./tmp>.  In such a case,
a warning will be issued.
